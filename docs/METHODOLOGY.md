# Valuation methodology

What Thesis computes, from which inputs, under which conventions, and where a
convention is this project's own choice rather than a standard.

Two rules govern everything below. Every number carries a source and an as-of
date. Where a rule is a house convention rather than an established method, it
says so in the same breath as the number it produces — in the DCF assumption
block, in the report's missing-data manifest, or both.

## WACC inputs

The discount rate is never printed as a bare percentage. Every input is named
with its source and its date, in the DCF assumption block (`WACC (discount
rate)` row) and in the report's computed-returns notes.

| Input | Source | Convention |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Risk-free rate | FMP treasury rates (`year10`), else **FRED `DGS10`** | The series id and the observation date are both stated. |
| Equity risk premium | FMP market-risk-premium (US `totalEquityRiskPremium`), else the dated **Damodaran** implied-ERP fallback | The fallback carries its own publication date and is rejected once it is older than 210 days rather than used stale. A value outside [3%, 25%] is treated as implausible and falls back. |
| Beta | Provider profile beta, **Blume-adjusted** (0.67·raw + 0.33), clamped to [0.6, 2.0] | Raw beta outside (0, 4] is unusable and the WACC fails closed rather than inventing market exposure. |
| Cost of equity | rf + beta × ERP | Clamped to [rf + 2.5%, 25%]. |
| Cost of debt | `effective` (interest expense ÷ average total debt), `historical` (the issuer's last year that still disclosed interest), or `synthetic` (rf + rating spread from interest coverage, Damodaran's January 2026 table) | The method actually used is named. An effective rate outside [rf − 1, rf + 19] is rejected in favour of the synthetic rating. Debt below 2% of assets is treated as noise. |
| Tax rate | Observed effective rate (ratios TTM, else annual ratios, else TTM tax expense ÷ pre-tax income) | Clamped to [0%, 35%]. Where it came from is named. No universal statutory rate is ever assumed. |
| Weights | Market value of equity (market capitalisation) and book total debt as a market-value proxy, averaged over the latest two balance sheets | Stated as E% / D%. When the statements' currency differs from the quote currency (the ADR case) the weights are suppressed rather than silently mixed. |

The final WACC is clamped to [max(6%, rf + 1%), 20%]; a clamp that moves the
rate by 0.5pp or more is disclosed in the manifest, because it materially
changes the discount rate.

**Per-fiscal-year WACC.** The ROIC-versus-WACC history recomputes the WACC at
each fiscal year end from the risk-free observation on or before that date,
holding beta, ERP, the E/D weights and the tax rate constant. A *synthetic*
cost of debt moves with the risk-free rate, because it is rf + spread; an
observed effective rate is held, because it is a fact about that issuer's debt.
An observation more than 14 days before a year end is not that year's rate and
is rejected. Years that cannot be recomputed are named, and the note then says
the current WACC was applied to them. FRED history is fetched five years back,
so roughly five fiscal years can carry their own rate.

## Growth anchor

Near-term revenue growth is the **median of every method the data supports**,
with the full range shown and each method's value named:

1. **Log-linear regression** of ln(revenue) on elapsed years, over *all*
   annual years on record. Reported with its slope, R² and n. Using every year
   means a spike or a collapse inside the window shows up as a poor fit rather
   than moving the anchor.
2. **Three-year revenue CAGR**.
3. **Five-year revenue CAGR**.
4. **Analyst-consensus case**, when FMP analyst estimates exist: the average
   implied growth over the next two fiscal years. The first leg is annualised
   by day count when the TTM window and the first estimated year end are not a
   full year apart, and is skipped entirely below 90 days as too noisy.

The point estimate is the median; the range is min..max across the available
methods. Methods that could not be computed are named in the assumption block
and disclosed as a `valuation.dcf.growthAnchor` manifest entry.

The median is then **clamped to [−10%, +25%]**, and the anchor the report
prints is the clamped value — the same number the growth path fades from.
When the clamp moves it, the anchor's basis says so, the growth-path basis
repeats it, and the assumption row reads "25.0% (…, clamped from the 65.0%
median)". Nothing prints the pre-clamp median as if it were the anchor.

**Three of the four methods read the same series.** The regression, the 3-year
CAGR and the 5-year CAGR are all functions of the same annual revenue history,
so the median is weighted roughly three to one toward that history and the
analyst-consensus case rarely moves it — it can only shift the median when it
lands between the three history-derived values, and never sets the anchor on
its own. That is a deliberate bias toward the filed record over sell-side
expectations, but it means the consensus case should not be read as an equal
fourth vote. The range printed beside the point estimate is where a large
analyst/history disagreement becomes visible.

**Two rules were retired here, and the assumption block says so.** The former
"lower of the 3Y/5Y CAGR" rule let whichever window happened to be worse
decide ten years of growth — that is a coin flip on the window, not
conservatism. The former sign-disagreement rule replaced the anchor with the
terminal rate whenever the two windows disagreed in sign, discarding the whole
revenue history on the strength of two endpoints. Both are gone; the
regression's R² is where an erratic history now shows up.

---

## Fade and horizon

The explicit horizon is **10 years**, stated in years in the assumption block.
Growth fades linearly from the anchor in year 1 to the terminal rate in year
10. The EBIT margin fades from the current margin to a target over 5 years and
is held flat thereafter; the target is the five-year median, or the better/
worse of median and current under a dated improving/declining margin regime
(a slope of more than ±0.5pp per year). The tax rate fades from the observed
effective rate to the company's own historical median. Cash flows are
discounted on the **mid-year convention**.

EBIT itself is the issuer's operating income: the filed line where the filer
reports one, otherwise a derivation from pre-tax income that adds back interest
expense and removes the non-operating results the filing discloses. It is never
pre-tax income plus interest on its own. That sum reintroduces every
non-operating item the derivation removed, and where the derivation is refused
outright — a bank, where interest is an operating cost, or a non-operating
aggregate that already contains the interest being added back — EBIT is
withheld and named in the missing-data manifest rather than published under a
second name.

Terminal growth is **min(2.5%, risk-free rate)** — nothing grows faster than
the risk-free rate in perpetuity (Damodaran). Like the terminal-ROIC rule below
it prints as a HOUSE CONVENTION, in those words, wherever it appears. A Gordon guard requires
WACC − g ≥ 2.0pp in the base case (1.5pp in the sensitivity grid, where a
tighter guard would blank cells the grid exists to show); when it binds, g is
pulled down and the note says so.

---

## Terminal value house convention

**This is a house convention, not a standard, and it is labelled as such
wherever it is printed.**

The default terminal ROIC equals the WACC: growth adds nothing after the
explicit horizon. That is the Koller/Goedhart/Wessels recommendation for most
firms. Applied to every issuer, however, it values an evidenced compounder as
if its returns collapsed to the cost of capital in year 11.

So: when ROIC exceeded the WACC in **each of the last four or more fiscal
years on record**, half the median spread is carried in perpetuity, capped at
**5 percentage points**. A carried spread below 0.5pp is treated as noise and
the default holds. Anything short of that evidence keeps the default, and the
reason is written into the assumption notes. This follows McKinsey's RONIC
guidance (a top-quintile ROIC advantage roughly halves over 10–15 years rather
than closing) and Damodaran's allowance of perpetual excess returns only when
they are modest.

Each fiscal year is compared to **its own** WACC where one could be recomputed
(see *WACC inputs* above); otherwise the current WACC is applied to every year
and the note says exactly that. Any year that could not be recomputed also
reaches the missing-data manifest as `returns.wacc.history`, including the
partial case where only some years are missing. When a history is supplied but
no year carries a computable ROIC there is no comparison at all, and the note
says that — not that a risk-free observation was missing.

The per-year WACCs are always recomputed from **FRED `DGS10`**, while the
current WACC prefers the provider's own 10-year treasury rate and falls back to
`DGS10`. When those two differ, the returns notes say so explicitly: the newest
fiscal year's own WACC can then differ from the current one because the two
rates come from different series, not because the rate moved.

Terminal reinvestment is g ÷ ROIC_terminal, Damodaran's consistency rule.

---

## FCF and SBC

**Free cash flow subtracts stock-based compensation by default.** The
cash-flow statement adds SBC back to operating cash flow because no cash left
the building that period, but the expense is real: it is settled in newly
issued shares, and the bill lands on existing holders as dilution. Damodaran's
treatment in *Stock Based Compensation: The Elephant in the Room* is to treat
it as an operating expense that should not be added back.

Both figures are reported and never conflated:

- `fcfBeforeSbc` — operating cash flow + capital expenditure (capex arrives
  negative), the vendor convention.
- `fcf` — the same figure less SBC, the house default.

A year with no disclosed SBC is left unadjusted, says so per row, and raises an
info-level `capital.fcf.sbc` manifest entry, so an unadjusted year is never
silently compared with an adjusted one. SBC as a percentage of FCF is measured
against the **before** figure: dividing SBC by an FCF it has already been
subtracted from would count it twice.

Every surface that prints a free-cash-flow figure names which one it is. The
payload and the data-only report label the rows "after SBC, house default" and
"before SBC, vendor convention", and both series are shown. Two conversion
ratios are published the same way, and the **before**-SBC one is the ratio the
balance-sheet grade scores, under a driver named `fcfConversionBeforeSbc`: that
is the definition the conversion band was calibrated on, and grading the
after-SBC ratio against it would charge the same expense twice, because SBC as a
percentage of free cash flow is already one of the five scored metrics. The
aspect note states the definition. Price to free cash flow uses the **before**
figure — the same basis as the own-history distribution it is ranked in — and is
labelled "P/FCF (before SBC)" wherever it renders, with the basis string saying
that the capital block's house-default figure is a different number.

The FCFF discounted-cash-flow model projects revenue, EBIT margin and
reinvestment. SBC is already an operating expense inside that EBIT, so it is
never added back there either. The DCF and the free-cash-flow metric are
consistent, but they are not the same series, and the assumption block says so.

## Dilution

Dilution from outstanding awards is reported as the gap between the **diluted**
and **basic** weighted-average share counts of the latest fiscal year, with the
as-of date and the overhang in percent. It reaches readers as a capital figure
in the Stage C payload and as a capital-allocation note in the data-only
report, and the note is emitted in BOTH states — the unavailable case says so
in words rather than going silent. A missing count is disclosed
(`capital.dilution`), never assumed to be zero.

Stock-based compensation is subtracted from free cash flow **with the sign the
filer reported**. The us-gaap element is a positive add-back inside operating
cash flow, so a negative figure is a net credit — forfeiture reversals
exceeding the period's awards — and it is added back rather than charged. Awards that are antidilutive in
a loss year are excluded from the diluted count by the filer, so a loss-making
issuer's overhang understates the award pool; the note says this.

Separately, the five-year diluted share-count trend reports buyback, dilution
or flat (within ±1%), annualised over the span actually available.

Per-share values use the weighted-average diluted count from the newer of the
latest quarterly and latest annual income statement; when only the annual count
is available, the report says the figure may lag recent buybacks or issuance.

---

## EV bridge

Enterprise value is computed the same way everywhere it is used:

```
EV = market capitalisation
   + total debt
   + preferred stock
   + minority interest (non-controlling interests)
   - cash and short-term investments
```

Preferred and minority interests are claims senior to common equity, so they
belong in EV; undisclosed means zero, following the provider's convention. The
DCF's equity bridge is the same identity read backwards: equity value =
EV − net debt − minority interest − preferred equity.

**The OPERATING-lease liability is excluded by default; the finance-lease
liability is not.** The option to keep the operating slice in is
`THESIS_EV_INCLUDE_LEASES=1`. The split is the whole point. Under US GAAP
(ASC 842) operating-lease cost stays in operating expenses, so EBIT and EBITDA
are already *after* it and adding that liability to EV as well double-counts the
leases in EV/EBITDA. Finance-lease cost is *not* in either figure: it is split
between right-of-use amortisation, which EBITDA adds back, and interest, which
sits below EBIT. The finance-lease liability is therefore debt in both frames
and stays in enterprise value and in net debt, always. The provider's
`totalDebt` contains both, so the default subtracts the operating slice back out
and leaves the finance slice where it is.

Only the EDGAR route resolves the split: the lease chain there sums a separately
resolved operating and finance liability, and the operating slice is published
as its own balance-sheet field. FMP publishes one combined
`capitalLeaseObligations` and no split, so on that route **no lease adjustment
is made at all** — enterprise value is reported as-is and an info-level
`valuation.multiples.enterpriseValue.leases` manifest entry says that removing
the combined figure would strip an unknown amount of finance-lease debt out of
EV. The same entry fires when no lease liability is disclosed at all. Nothing is
guessed, and nothing unknown is netted.

Both enterprise values — as reported, and less the operating-lease liability —
are computed, together with the total lease liability and its finance slice.
They are published in the EV bridge basis string, which is a computed valuation
note and is quoted verbatim into the EV/EBITDA and EV/sales basis lines and into
the DCF equity-bridge note; there is no separate assumption-block row for them.
Turning the option on raises a warning-level manifest entry stating that
EV/EBITDA then pairs a lease-inclusive numerator with a lease-expensed
denominator and is not comparable to the default basis. The DCF equity bridge
follows the identical convention through net debt, so the two can never
disagree.

**The own-history enterprise value carries the same adjustment.** Each
historical quarter window removes *its own* operating-lease liability whenever
the current EV removed one, so the rank compares like with like. A window whose
balance sheet discloses no operating-lease liability cannot be put on that basis;
its EV/EBITDA and EV/sales are dropped from the distribution — never ranked
against a differently-defined history — and the count of dropped windows is
disclosed as `valuation.multiples.ownHistory.evLeaseBasis`. The vendor's
pre-baked EV ratios are built on the vendor's own lease-inclusive enterprise
value, so when the adjustment fires those bands are withheld under the same
manifest entry rather than published on a basis the current number does not
share.

---

## Multiples and own-history ranks

Current multiples are computed from raw statement fields, never from a
vendor's pre-baked ratio. Which multiples are meaningful depends on the route:
banks and insurers never get EV multiples, because debt is their raw material;
equity REITs lead with P/FFO and P/AFFO.

The own-history figure is a **rank among N quarters**, not a percentile. The
window is 8 to 20 quarterly observations — far too few to estimate a
percentile of a distribution, and CFA Institute guidance is to describe such a
figure as a rank within the observed sample. The numeric field keeps its
historical name for backward compatibility with persisted reports, but its
description, every rendered label, the basis strings and the missing-data
reason all say rank.

**N is rendered beside the rank**, not left in a note: the multiples row carries
`ownHistoryObservations`, and every surface prints it — "rank 62/100 of 12
quarters" in the Markdown and print-HTML exports, "rank 62 of 12 quarters" on
the app's own-history bar. A report persisted before that field existed still parses and
still renders, without inventing an N. The field is optional in Zod for exactly
that reason and is stripped from the judge's request schema — the judge never
authors this table (`applyMultiples` replaces it wholesale from computed
numbers), so carrying it costs nothing against the request schema's
optional-parameter budget. The score drivers built from the rank are named
`peOwnHistoryRank`, `priceToTbvOwnHistoryRank` and `pFfoOwnHistoryRank` with
unit `rank`, the valuation aspect note says rank, and the Stage C prompt
instructs the model in the same terms, so the narrative cannot call it a
percentile either.

Fewer than 8 quarters produces no rank at all. Fewer than 20 (a full five
years) flags the window as low-sample, because at those sizes the 5th and 95th
percentiles track the near-minimum and near-maximum rather than stable
quantiles; the median and quartiles remain robust. A multiple rendered "n/m"
(a negative or zero denominator) loses its rank too, so the report can never
show a rank for a number it declines to print.

Peer medians are trimmed of n/m values and 1.5×IQR outliers and suppressed
below four surviving peers. Peer multiples are not currently supplied by the
pipeline; that is disclosed as a missing input, not reported as a finding that
the company has no peers.

## Financial-company routes

How a company is routed, what each route withholds and why, how a financial is
valued instead, which route metrics are computed, and how FFO and AFFO are
defined. Decisions D-16 and D-17.

### Routing

#### Three inputs, in order

A company's base route is decided by the vendor industry string, the SEC SIC
code, and tag evidence read from EDGAR companyfacts.

1. **Industry prefix** (case-insensitive, trimmed): `Banks…` → bank,
   `Insurance…` → insurer (except `Insurance - Brokers`, which is fee-based and
   goes to the general map), `REIT…` → REIT.
2. **SIC fallback**, consulted only when the industry string gives no match:
   6020-6199 → bank, 6300-6499 → insurer, 6798 → REIT (sub-map undecided, see
   §1.3), sector "Financial Services" without a matching industry → the general
   map (the FIN-OTHER treatment).
3. **XBRL evidence** (`src/pipeline/stageB/routingEvidence.ts`), read-only from
   the bundle's companyfacts payload.

#### What the tags decide

| Evidence | Conclusion |
| --- | --- |
| deposits **and** (loans **or** net interest income) | bank |
| premiums earned **and** loss or policy reserves | insurer |
| `RealEstateInvestmentPropertyNet` / `…AtCost` | equity REIT |
| mortgage-backed securities **or** mortgage loans held for investment, **and no** investment property, **corroborated** (see below) | mortgage REIT |

Four deliberate properties:

- **A single line item is not a business model.** Deposits alone do not make a
  filer a bank; a loan or net-interest-income tag must accompany them. An
  industrial holding customer deposits is not misrouted.
- **The tags in a group name the business model.** The mortgage-REIT groups
  carry only elements whose names are mortgage-specific
  (`MortgageBackedSecurities…`, `MortgageLoansOnRealEstate…`,
  `LoansReceivableHeldForInvestmentNet`). Generic elements —
  `AvailableForSaleSecuritiesDebtSecurities` and its two spellings, which is
  what any corporate treasury tags for its bond portfolio, and
  `NotesReceivableNet` / `LoansAndLeasesReceivableNetReportedAmount` /
  `FinancingReceivableExcludingAccruedInterestAfterAllowanceForCreditLoss`,
  which is what a manufacturer with vendor financing tags — are **not** in them.
  They were, and they routed ordinary industrials to the mortgage-REIT map,
  which suppresses the DCF, the reverse DCF, EV/EBITDA and ROIC−WACC, drops
  Piotroski to three signals and leads the report with book value per share.
- **The one single-group rule needs corroboration before it may re-route.** Bank
  evidence needs two groups and insurer evidence needs two; the mortgage-REIT
  rule fires on one, so it is the weakest evidence the module produces. Before
  it may SET a base route, either the repo funding a levered mortgage book
  cannot run without (`SecuritiesSoldUnderAgreementsToRepurchase`) or an
  already-financial SIC/sector must corroborate it. Uncorroborated, the tags are
  filed as `route.evidence.conflict` (`warn`) and the route is left where it
  was.
- **A retired tag cannot classify a filer today.** A tag counts only when its
  newest non-zero fact, from a core form (10-K/10-Q/20-F and their amendments,
  after the max-`filed` dedup), falls within 24 months of the newest evidence
  fact on file.
- **The property tag wins for hybrids.** A REIT that files investment property
  *and* mortgage assets is an equity REIT; the mortgage classification requires
  the absence of investment property.

#### Evidence confirms or contradicts; it does not silently override

- Neither industry nor SIC matched → evidence **decides** the base route, and
  the note names the tags, their values, their period ends, and the industry and
  SIC inputs that failed to decide. The one exception is the mortgage-REIT rule,
  which fires on a single tag group and must first be corroborated (§1.2);
  uncorroborated, it is filed as `route.evidence.conflict` and changes nothing.
- Industry/SIC matched and evidence agrees → the note records the confirmation.
- Industry/SIC matched and evidence disagrees → **the declared classification
  stands**, and the disagreement is filed as `route.evidence.conflict` (`warn`).
  A vendor string and an SEC code are evidence too; the honest outcome is a
  disclosed conflict, not a silent re-route.
- Companyfacts unavailable → `route.evidence` (`info`), raised only for
  financial candidates, so an ordinary industrial's manifest is not padded with
  a check that was never relevant.

#### The REIT sub-map, and why SIC 6798 cannot decide it

SIC 6798 is "Real Estate Investment Trusts" and covers equity and mortgage REITs
alike. The two maps disagree about which metrics are meaningful: FFO is the
equity REIT's earnings measure and is close to meaningless for a mortgage REIT,
whose assets are marked securities and whose headline is book value.

The sub-map is therefore decided by evidence or by an explicit vendor sub-type,
never by the SIC:

- `RealEstateInvestmentPropertyNet` present → **equity**.
- Mortgage assets present without investment property → **mortgage**.
- Vendor industry naming a sub-type (`REIT - Mortgage`, `REIT - Industrial`) →
  that sub-map. A vendor mortgage label contradicted by filed investment
  property is kept but flagged (`route.reitSubmap.conflict`).
- Otherwise → **`undetermined`**.

A keyless profile derives its industry string from the SIC map itself, so
`REIT - Diversified` on SIC 6798 carries no information beyond the SIC and is
**not** read as a vendor sub-type. Treating it as one would launder the SIC into
evidence it is not.

`undetermined` withholds **both** metric families — FFO, AFFO, P/FFO, the AFFO
payout ratio and the implied cap rate on one side; book value per share, the net
interest spread and assets/equity leverage on the other — with the reason on the
`route.reitSubmap` manifest entry. Publishing either set would assert a business
model the evidence does not support.

### Valuing a financial company

#### What is withheld, and why

Damodaran's treatment of financial service firms is the authority for the
central point: for a bank, an insurer or a mortgage REIT, debt is **raw
material**, not financing. Four consequences, each withheld with a stated reason
in the notes and the missing-data manifest:

| Withheld | Manifest key | Reason |
| --- | --- | --- |
| FCFF/WACC DCF | `valuation.dcf` | free cash flow to the firm subtracts debt service from an operating cash flow that here *is* financing activity |
| FCFF reverse DCF | `valuation.reverseDcf` | inverts the same model; the growth or margin it solves for inherits the same category error |
| EV/EBITDA | `valuation.evEbitda` | enterprise value adds debt and subtracts cash, both operating items here — a profitable bank can show a negative EV |
| ROIC − WACC | `returns.roicVsWacc` | invested capital (debt + equity − cash) is undefined when deposits, policy reserves or repo fund the assets and cash is itself an earning asset |

Equity REITs additionally withhold a **net-income DCF**
(`valuation.netIncomeDcf`): GAAP net income is struck after real-estate
depreciation, a large non-cash charge against assets that typically hold or gain
value, so discounting it understates the company. FFO exists precisely because
of this.

#### The excess-return equity model

The replacement is an equity-side residual-income model — Damodaran's excess
return model, stated as:

```
Equity value = BV0 + Σ_{t=1..N}  (ROE_t − CoE) × BV_{t−1} / (1 + CoE)^t
```

with, all printed as assumptions in their own right:

- **Horizon `N`** — explicit, 10 years by default. The excess return is
  discounted year by year to year `N`, and **no continuing value is added**
  beyond it.
- **Fade** — ROE fades **linearly** from the current ROE to the cost of equity
  over exactly that horizon, so the year-`N` excess return is zero by
  construction. This is the equity-side analogue of the DCF core's terminal
  ROIC = WACC rule, and it is why no terminal value is needed. A caller may
  override the terminal ROE to assert persistent excess; the override is
  reflected honestly in a non-zero `terminalExcess` and in the basis string.
  Production never supplies it.
- **Discount rate** — the **cost of equity**, never a WACC. A WACC would blend
  in the cost of deposits, policy reserves or repo, which are this company's raw
  material rather than its financing. A null cost of equity **suppresses** the
  model with a critical gap rather than defaulting a rate.
- **Opening book value `BV0`** — the latest total stockholders' equity. Later
  years compound at `ROE × retention`, where retention is `1 − payout`. A loss is
  retained in full: `roe × retention` on a negative ROE would return a fraction
  of the loss to book value, which is arithmetically a capital injection.
- **Payout** — dividends plus net buybacks over net income, three-year average
  from the annual cash-flow statements. Missing history suppresses the model
  rather than assuming a universal payout.

The model also reverse-solves the **starting** ROE that reproduces the current
market cap, under the same fade the forward path uses. Inverting a *different*
model (a flat ROE, as an earlier version did) made the solved figure
systematically low, because a flat path is worth more than a fading one, and
biased every financial toward "the market is too pessimistic". A clean property
follows from the identity: an issuer priced at book solves to exactly the cost
of equity.

#### P/TBV against ROTE

The multiple a financial is actually read on is price to **tangible** book, and
the return that justifies it is return on **tangible** common equity. Both use
the same denominator — equity less goodwill, other intangibles and preferred —
because goodwill absorbs losses only after common equity is gone, and pairing a
book-value multiple with a tangible-equity return would compare two different
bases. A goodwill-heavy acquirer at 1.0× book can be at 2.0× tangible book.

The justified multiple is a **stable-growth cross-check**, in the Gordon form of
the residual-income identity:

```
justified P/TBV = (ROTE − g) / (CoE − g),
g = min(ROTE × retention, terminal-growth cap 2.5%, risk-free rate)
```

Two things it is **not**:

- It is **not the forward model read as a multiple.** §2.2 fades ROE linearly to
  the cost of equity over ten years and adds no continuing value; this identity
  assumes ROTE persists in perpetuity. They rest on different assumptions and
  can legitimately disagree — the difference is the value of persistence, and
  the basis string says so. (An earlier version of this section, and of the
  basis string, claimed the two "cannot disagree". That was false: at ROTE 16%,
  CoE 10% and a 50% payout the forward model reads 1.26× tangible book while the
  uncapped identity read 4.00×.)
- It is **not exempt from the house growth rule.** `g` obeys the same ceiling the
  DCF terminal value obeys — nothing grows faster than the risk-free rate
  forever. Uncapped, `g = ROTE × retention` reached 9.4% for a regional bank at
  ROTE 14% with a one-third payout, giving a justified 7.45×, so a bank at 1.5×
  tangible book printed a premium of −5.95× while the pipeline's own fair value
  called it roughly fairly priced. Capped, the same bank reads 1.53×. When no
  risk-free rate is supplied the cap is the 2.5% terminal-growth ceiling alone,
  and the basis string says which bound applied.

The multiple is **withheld, never clamped**, when `CoE − g` falls below 0.5pp:
the ratio diverges through infinity there, and any number it produced would be an
artefact of the arithmetic rather than a valuation. When ROTE, the cost of equity
or the payout history is missing, the multiple is still shown and the justified
figure is withheld with its reason.

### Route metrics

`src/pipeline/stageB/financialMetrics.ts` computes the figures each financial
route leads with, from the filer's own XBRL tags, read-only. Two rules govern
every metric:

1. **A named metric is computed only from the figures its definition calls
   for.** Where those figures are not on file the metric is **withheld with a
   reason**, which reaches the manifest as `financialMetrics.<key>`.
2. **A stand-in is published under its own name**, never the name of the metric
   it stands in for, and is marked `proxy`.

#### Banks

| Metric | Definition | When withheld |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Net interest margin | net interest income / average **earning** assets | whenever the filer tags no earning-assets element. us-gaap carries no standard average-earning-assets concept, and total assets include premises, goodwill and other non-earning items, so dividing by them would understate the margin. |
| Net interest income / average total assets | the honest denominator that *is* available | published as a labeled stand-in beside a withheld NIM, stating that it sits below a true NIM |
| Efficiency ratio | noninterest expense / (net interest income + noninterest income) | when the noninterest split is not tagged. This split exists in the filings even though vendor income statements omit it. |
| CET1 | company-reported CET1 capital / risk-weighted assets | when no CET1 element is tagged (it is often only in the regulatory-capital footnote text) |
| Tangible leverage | (equity − goodwill − intangibles − preferred) / (assets − goodwill − intangibles) | the labeled stand-in for CET1; it does **not** risk-weight assets, so it is not comparable to a regulatory capital ratio and is always the more conservative read |
| NPL ratio | nonaccrual loans / total loans | when nonaccrual loans are filed only by loan class (dimensional facts companyfacts does not expose as a total) |
| Provisions / loans | provision for credit losses / total loans | when neither the provision element nor its component sum resolves |
| Cost of deposits | interest expense on deposits / average deposits | when `InterestExpenseDeposits` is untagged — total interest expense covers borrowings too and would overstate it |

#### Insurers

| Metric | Definition |
| --- | --- |
| Loss ratio | incurred claims / premiums earned |
| Expense ratio | (other underwriting expense **+** deferred-policy-acquisition-cost amortisation) / premiums earned — **both** components required |
| Combined ratio | loss ratio + expense ratio |
| Reserve development | incurred claims attributable to prior accident years; positive is adverse, negative is a favourable release |

The expense ratio's numerator is the sum of `OtherUnderwritingExpense` and
`DeferredPolicyAcquisitionCostAmortizationExpense`, and **both** must resolve.
A partial component sum is not a total: an insurer tagging only the
acquisition-cost amortisation would publish a 12% expense ratio and a 77%
combined ratio — an underwriter that does not exist — so the ratio is withheld
naming the component that is missing. `InsuranceCommissionsAndFees` is not in
the numerator: it is a credit-balance revenue element, and summing it inflated
both the expense and combined ratios.

The denominator is **GAAP premiums earned**. A statutory expense ratio divides by
premiums *written*, so the computed figure is not directly comparable to a
statutory filing, and the company-reported combined ratio remains the gold
standard — the computed one is labeled a computation. The combined ratio is
**withheld outright when either half is missing**: a loss-ratio-only figure
reads materially flattering (64% where the real combined figure is 92%).

#### Mortgage REITs

| Metric | Definition |
| --- | --- |
| Book value per share | (total equity − preferred) / shares |
| Leverage | total assets / total equity |
| Net interest spread | interest income / average earning assets − interest expense / average interest-bearing liabilities — **withheld**, see below |
| Net interest spread (repo-funded) | interest income / average total assets − **total** interest expense / **average** repurchase agreements — the labeled stand-in |

Total assets is a fair yield denominator here — unlike at a bank — because a
mortgage REIT's assets are interest-earning securities and loans. The funding
leg is a different matter: companyfacts exposes only the repurchase-agreement
balance, while the interest-expense numerator covers every borrowing the REIT
runs. Dividing one by the other overstates the cost of funds and can flip the
sign of the spread — interest income 3.9bn on average assets 75bn against
interest expense 3.0bn over 50bn of repo prints −0.8% for a company reporting a
positive spread. So the named metric is **withheld** and the repo-funded
computation is published under its own name and marked a proxy, exactly as NIM
gives way to net interest income over average total assets. Both legs are
averaged over the current and prior period ends, so the two halves use the same
denominator convention. Either figure is withheld when a leg or its balance is
missing; a one-legged figure would misstate it.

### FFO and AFFO (NAREIT)

FFO follows the NAREIT white-paper definition:

```
FFO = net income (GAAP)
    + real-estate depreciation and amortization
    − gains on sales of property
    + impairments of depreciable real estate
```

Applied exactly where the filer tags the components. Two stand-ins exist, and
both err in the same direction — FFO sits at or **above** the definition — so
both are labeled **approximate** with the direction stated:

- Where **real-estate** depreciation is not tagged separately, total
  depreciation and amortization is added back; NAREIT adds back only the
  real-estate portion.
- Where the **real-estate impairment** element is not tagged, the generic
  `AssetImpairmentCharges` is added back; NAREIT adds back only impairments of
  depreciable real estate, so a goodwill write-down inside that charge does not
  belong in FFO. `ImpairmentOfInvestments` — a securities write-down — is not in
  the chain at all.

The gain the definition subtracts is a gain on selling **real estate**:
`GainLossOnSaleOfProperties`, `GainsLossesOnSalesOfInvestmentRealEstate` (the
element most equity REITs use), `GainLossOnSaleOfRealEstate` and the
net-of-tax spelling. The generic `GainLossOnDispositionOfAssets1` is not one of
them — it covers disposals NAREIT does not exclude. Untagged gains and
impairments are treated as zero and the note says so, naming the direction: a
disposition gain the filer did not tag leaves FFO overstated by that gain.

AFFO subtracts recurring (maintenance) capital expenditure and straight-line
rent where the filer tags them. Where it does not, AFFO falls back to
`FFO − all capital expenditure` and is disclosed as a **conservative floor**,
since development spending is subtracted too.

FFO is measured on **one** period: the latest fiscal year. Every XBRL component
resolves at that period end, so the statement fallbacks are read from the same
fiscal year rather than from a trailing window — a fiscal-year net income against
trailing depreciation is a hybrid of two periods, not a figure. The REIT
valuation block carries that period end as its as-of, and the notes say that the
share price in P/FFO is current while the FFO it divides is up to three quarters
old.

P/FFO and P/AFFO are computed from these figures. When the REIT sub-map is
`undetermined` (§1.4) every FFO-based figure is withheld.

### Forensic batteries by route

Piotroski (2000) built the F-score on non-financial firms; Altman excluded
financial institutions from every Z-model estimation sample; Beneish (1999)
excluded them from the M-score sample (p. 5). The routing layer honours those
sample definitions rather than producing a number outside them.

#### Altman Z, Beneish M, accrual ratios

All three are withheld on the bank, insurer and mortgage-REIT routes, and on any
issuer whose sector is "Financial Services" or whose SIC falls in 6000-6499 or
6700-6799 (equity REITs excepted, with a caution note). Each files its reason in
the manifest — `forensics.altmanZ`, `forensics.beneishM`,
`forensics.accrualsRatio` — because a blank cell with no reason reads as a fetch
that failed rather than as a deliberate refusal.

SIC major group 65 (real-estate operators, agents and managers) is deliberately
outside the exclusion band: those are ordinary operating companies with
inventory, receivables and a working-capital cycle.

#### Piotroski F, on three scales

The score is reported over the signals that remain, with its own denominator,
and the result carries a variant and a label so a reduced score is never read
against the 9-point scale. The label's withheld count is derived from the
signals that are actually null and names them, so a data gap that drops a
further signal is never reported as one of the route's own withholdings.

| Scale | Applies to | Signals withheld |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 9 | general route | none |
| 5 | FIN-OTHER: sector "Financial Services" or a financial SIC, but routed to the general map (asset managers, exchanges, insurance brokers) | CFO > 0, CFO > net income, current ratio, gross margin |
| 3 | bank, insurer, mortgage REIT | the four above **plus** ΔLEVER and ΔTURN |

Reasons:

- **The two cash-flow signals** presume an operating cash flow that measures
  earnings quality. A bank's is dominated by loan, deposit, trading-asset and
  reserve flows. (JPMorgan scored 2/6 in the 2026-09-02 keyless sweep with both
  misses on these tests.)
- **The current ratio** presumes a current/non-current split an unclassified
  financial balance sheet does not have.
- **Gross margin** presumes a cost of revenue; revenue − cost of revenue is
  meaningless on a net-interest-spread or premium income statement.
- **ΔLEVER** treats long-term debt over assets as a solvency burden. On these
  routes debt is an input, and the funding that matters — deposits, policy
  reserves, repo — is not long-term debt at all, so a falling ratio is a
  funding-mix change. A bank shrinking bond issuance while deposits grow would
  score a deleveraging point it did not earn.
- **ΔTURN** reads revenue over assets as operating efficiency. A financial
  company's assets *are* its revenue-generating book, so the ratio tracks the
  rate environment and balance-sheet mix; it falls when a bank adds low-yield
  liquidity.

The 5-signal scale exists because the FIN-OTHER issuers are fee-based with
ordinary balance sheets: their debt is debt and their assets are not their
revenue-generating book, so ΔLEVER and ΔTURN still mean what the paper says.
This mirrors the ROTE-vs-ROIC switch, which is likewise narrower than the
forensic classifier.

Nothing is dropped silently at any scale: each withheld signal keeps its reason
on the signal itself, the manifest entry names every withheld signal and the
denominator used, and the notes state that the score is not comparable to a
9-point F-score.

## Disclaimer scope

Every report carries this text verbatim:

> Informational only — not investment advice. This report contains A-F letter
> grades and scenario price targets; both are model outputs derived from the
> data and assumptions disclosed here, and neither is a recommendation to buy,
> sell, or hold any security.

The disclaimer names what the report actually emits. It grades six aspects on
an A–F scale and prints bull, base and bear scenario price targets; both are
deterministic model outputs computed from the inputs disclosed above, and both
are only as good as those inputs. Neither is a rating. The report contains no
buy, sell or hold recommendation, no allocation directive, and no price target
authored by a person.

Renderers print the disclaimer stored on the report as written, so a report
generated under an earlier version keeps the text that was in force when it was
produced.
